# Greene Versions

All versions on Greene are unsupported and deprecated.

## Former Greene versions

* **greene:** The version worked on by NYU team (Varshitha). Last modification dates back to July 2023. This version ws used for the arxiv paper. This version is no longer supported as Greenes software stack was changed and the program has not been updated.

* **greene_v0.5:** The main version where new modifications are made and experimented on Greene. This version uses cloudmesh-cc, but was only tested on rivanna. For that reason the version will be renamed to **rivanna-early-stoping**. It uses the ability to use early stopping introduced by the greene version, but does not use the shell script as cloudmesh-cc is easier to use and includes many more features.

* **greene-v0.4-backup-ruochen**: This is a backup of the last working version by Oct 2023 that originated from an earlier version of greene_v0.5 and used the shell script instead of cloudmesh-cc, see more in greene-v0.4-backup-ruochen/README-backup-note.md

* **deprecated/green_overlay**: This is an experimental version branched out from greene_v0.5 in Sep 2023, in attempt to adapt to Singularity with overlay. It is DEPRECATED.
